# News-App-Demo
 
Hello and welcome!  This demo is a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the newsapi.org service.

This is my first Full Stack Challenge and first ever project using React and Node/Express.

## Areas of improvement

If I had more time on the demo- I would have implemented Redux for use of state management. 
I also would included LESS as oppose to CSS and I would have given a pop at unit testing. 

Thank you very much for visiting.
